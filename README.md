# Experience the Unseen

## Overview
"Experience the Unseen" is a comprehensive desktop application designed to assist individuals with color blindness. This project integrates image processing techniques to offer a suite of functionalities aimed at improving interaction with the visual world for color-blind users.

## Features
1. **Simulator**: Simulates the visual perception of color-blind individuals, allowing users to understand how different types of color blindness affect their perception of the environment.
2. **Corrector**: Applies specialized color filters to enhance the ability of color-blind users to distinguish between colors more effectively.
3. **Color Detector**: Identifies and displays the name of the color at the mouse pointer's location in real-time.
4. **Tester**: Implements the Ishihara color test to determine whether users are affected by color blindness.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **.NET Framework**: Primary framework for building the Windows Forms application.
- **C#**: Programming language used for writing the application logic.
- **Windows Forms (WinForms)**: GUI class library for creating desktop applications.
- **OpenCV**: Open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, accessed via the **OpenCvSharp** wrapper for C#.
- **Various Windows Forms Controls**: Such as `OpenFileDialog`, `PictureBox`, `MessageBox`, etc.
- **OpenCV Data Structures**: Including `Mat`, `Vec3f`, and `Vec3b`.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/experience-the-unseen.git
    ```
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project.
4. Run the application.

## Usage
1. **Simulator**: Load an image to see how it would look to individuals with different types of color blindness.
2. **Corrector**: Apply color correction to an image to improve color differentiation.
3. **Color Detector**: Hover the mouse over different areas of the screen to identify colors in real-time.
4. **Tester**: Complete the Ishihara color test to assess color vision.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the transformation matrices and algorithms for more accurate simulations.
- Incorporate additional color blindness tests.
- Develop mobile and web-based versions of the application.
- Integrate with other assistive technologies for a more inclusive experience.
